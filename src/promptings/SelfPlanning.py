An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code $091$), a colon (ASCII code $058$), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code $124$), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code $093$). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it.

For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length $4$, $6$ and $7$. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. 

You are given a string $s$. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from $s$, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?


-----Input-----

The only line contains one string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500000$). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from $s$, print $-1$. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.

## Let's think step by step.

1. Take user input as a string `s`.
2. Calculate the length of the string `s` and assign it to the variable `n`.
3. Initialize variables `ind` and `bind` to store the indices of '[' and ']'.
4. Initialize a flag variable `f` to track whether '[' or ']' characters have been encountered.
5. Iterate through the string to find the index of the first '[' character after encountering ':' (indicated by the flag).
6. Reset the flag variable.
7. Iterate through the string in reverse to find the index of the last ']' character before encountering ':'.
8. Check conditions to determine if it's possible to obtain an accordion:
   - If '[' or ']' characters were not found, print -1.
   - If the order of '[' and ']' characters is incorrect, print -1.
9. If conditions are met:
   - Initialize the length of the accordion (`ans`) to 4 (opening and closing brackets, and two colons).
   - Count the number of '|' characters between '[' and ']' indices (inclusive).
   - Print the calculated length of the resulting accordion (`ans`).

Problem Description:
The Hat is a game of speedy explanation/guessing words (similar to Alias). It's fun. Try it! In this problem, we are talking about a variant of the game when the players are sitting at the table and everyone plays individually (i.e. not teams, but individual gamers play).$$$n$$$ people gathered in a room with $$$m$$$ tables ($$$n \ge 2m$$$). They want to play the Hat $$$k$$$ times. Thus, $$$k$$$ games will be played at each table. Each player will play in $$$k$$$ games.To do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.Players want to have the most "fair" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that:  At any table in each game there are either $$$\lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$$$ people or $$$\lceil\frac{n}{m}\rceil$$$ people (that is, either $$$n/m$$$ rounded down, or $$$n/m$$$ rounded up). Different numbers of people can play different games at the same table. Let's calculate for each player the value $$$b_i$$$ — the number of times the $$$i$$$-th player played at a table with $$$\lceil\frac{n}{m}\rceil$$$ persons ($$$n/m$$$ rounded up). Any two values of $$$b_i$$$must differ by no more than $$$1$$$. In other words, for any two players $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, it must be true $$$|b_i - b_j| \le 1$$$. For example, if $$$n=5$$$, $$$m=2$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, then at the request of the first item either two players or three players should play at each table. Consider the following schedules:  First game: $$$1, 2, 3$$$ are played at the first table, and $$$4, 5$$$ at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play $$$5, 1$$$, and at the second  — $$$2, 3, 4$$$. This schedule is not "fair" since $$$b_2=2$$$ (the second player played twice at a big table) and $$$b_5=0$$$ (the fifth player did not play at a big table). First game: $$$1, 2, 3$$$ are played at the first table, and $$$4, 5$$$ at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play $$$4, 5, 2$$$, and at the second one  — $$$1, 3$$$. This schedule is "fair": $$$b=[1,2,1,1,1]$$$ (any two values of $$$b_i$$$ differ by no more than $$$1$$$). Find any "fair" game schedule for $$$n$$$ people if they play on the $$$m$$$ tables of $$$k$$$ games.
Input Specification:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Each test case consists of one line that contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^5$$$) — the number of people, tables and games, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$nk$$$ ($$$n$$$ multiplied by $$$k$$$) over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.
Output Specification:
For each test case print a required schedule  — a sequence of $$$k$$$ blocks of $$$m$$$ lines. Each block corresponds to one game, a line in a block corresponds to one table. In each line print the number of players at the table and the indices of the players (numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) who should play at this table. If there are several required schedules, then output any of them. We can show that a valid solution always exists. You can output additional blank lines to separate responses to different sets of inputs.

   - Read n, m, and k for the current test case.
   - Initialize a list to store groups of players for each game.

   - Initialize a variable `z` to zero.
   - Check if the number of players is not divisible by the number of tables:

Problem Description:
You are given a permutation $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ of integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$. Your task is to find how many permutations $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$$$ are similar to permutation $$$a$$$. Two permutations $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ are considered similar if for all intervals $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$), the following condition is satisfied: $$$$$$\operatorname{MEX}([a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r])=\operatorname{MEX}([b_l,b_{l+1},\ldots,b_r]),$$$$$$ where the $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a collection of integers $$$c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k$$$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ which does not occur in collection $$$c$$$. For example, $$$\operatorname{MEX}([1,2,3,4,5])=0$$$, and $$$\operatorname{MEX}([0,1,2,4,5])=3$$$.Since the total number of such permutations can be very large, you will have to print its remainder modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.In this problem, a permutation of size $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[1,0,2,4,3]$$$ is a permutation, while $$$[0,1,1]$$$ is not, since $$$1$$$ appears twice in the array. $$$[0,1,3]$$$ is also not a permutation, since $$$n=3$$$ and there is a $$$3$$$ in the array.
Input Specification:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the size of permutation $$$a$$$. The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \lt n$$$) — the elements of permutation $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.
Output Specification:
For each test case, print a single integer, the number of permutations similar to permutation $$$a$$$, taken modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.
Sample Inputs: ['5\n\n5\n\n4 0 3 2 1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0 1 2 3\n\n6\n\n1 2 4 0 5 3\n\n8\n\n1 3 7 2 5 0 6 4']
Sample Outputs: ['2\n1\n1\n4\n72']
Note: NoteFor the first test case, the only permutations similar to $$$a=[4,0,3,2,1]$$$ are $$$[4,0,3,2,1]$$$ and $$$[4,0,2,3,1]$$$.For the second and third test cases, the given permutations are only similar to themselves.For the fourth test case, there are $$$4$$$ permutations similar to $$$a=[1,2,4,0,5,3]$$$:   $$$[1,2,4,0,5,3]$$$;  $$$[1,2,5,0,4,3]$$$;  $$$[1,4,2,0,5,3]$$$;  $$$[1,5,2,0,4,3]$$$.

They are numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$nm$$$. You should give exactly one seat to each person.It is known, that in this cinema as lower seat index you have as better you can see everything happening on the screen. $$$i$$$-th person has the level of sight $$$a_i$$$. Let's define $$$s_i$$$ as the seat index, that will be given to $$$i$$$-th person. You want to give better places for people with lower sight levels, so for any two people $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ such that $$$a_i &lt; a_j$$$ it should be satisfied that $$$s_i &lt; s_j$$$.After you will give seats to all people they will start coming to their seats. In the order from $$$1$$$ to $$$nm$$$, each person will enter the hall and sit in their seat. To get to their place, the person will go to their seat's row and start moving from the first seat in this row to theirs from left to right. While moving some places will be free, some will be occupied with people already seated. The inconvenience of the person is equal to the number of occupied seats he or she will go through.Let's consider an example: $$$m = 5$$$, the person has the seat $$$4$$$ in the first row, the seats $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$ in the first row are already occupied, the seats $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ are free. The inconvenience of this person will be $$$2$$$, because he will go through occupied seats $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$.Find the minimal total inconvenience (the sum of inconveniences of all people), that is possible to have by giving places for all people (all conditions should be satisfied).
Input Specification:
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 300$$$) — the number of rows and places in each row respectively. The second line of each test case contains $$$n \cdot m$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n \cdot m}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the sight level of $$$i$$$-th person. It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.
Output Specification:
For each test case print a single integer — the minimal total inconvenience that can be achieved.
Sample Inputs: ['7\n1 2\n1 2\n3 2\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n3 3\n3 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 2\n2 2\n1 1 2 1\n4 2\n50 50 50 50 3 50 50 50\n4 2\n6 6 6 6 2 2 9 6\n2 9\n1 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 3 1 1 3']
Sample Outputs: ['1\n0\n4\n0\n0\n0\n1']
Note: NoteIn the first test case, there is a single way to give seats: the first person sits in the first place and the second person — in the second. The total inconvenience is $$$1$$$.In the second test case the optimal seating looks like this:   In the third test case the optimal seating looks like this:   The number in a cell is the person's index that sits on this place.

The wolf wants Gregor to help him figure out the number of possible attack plans that involve eating exactly x pigs for various values of x (1 ≤ x ≤ 3n). Two attack plans are considered different, if they occur at different times or if the sets of little pigs to eat are different.

Note that all queries are independent, that is, the wolf does not eat the little pigs, he only makes plans!

Input

The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅ 10^5), the number of minutes the convention lasts and the number of queries the wolf asks.

Each of the next q lines contains a single integer x_i (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 3n), the number of pigs the wolf will eat in the i-th query.

Output

You should print q lines, with line i representing the number of attack plans if the wolf wants to eat x_i pigs. Since each query answer can be large, output each answer modulo 10^9+7.

Note

In the example test, n=2. Thus, there are 3 pigs at minute 1, and 6 pigs at minute 2. There are three queries: x=1, x=5, and x=6.

If the wolf wants to eat 1 pig, he can do so in 3+6=9 possible attack plans, depending on whether he arrives at minute 1 or 2.

If the wolf wants to eat 5 pigs, the wolf cannot arrive at minute 1, since there aren't enough pigs at that time. Therefore, the wolf has to arrive at minute 2, and there are 6 possible attack plans.

If the wolf wants to eat 6 pigs, his only plan is to arrive at the end of the convention and devour everybody.

Remember to output your answers modulo 10^9+7!

## Let's think step by step.

1. Read the number of minutes `n` and the number of queries `Q`.
2. Implement the `inverses` function to calculate inverses using modular arithmetic.
3. Initialize factorials and inverses using the `init` function from the `combi` namespace.
4. Initialize coefficients of polynomial `p(x)` using binomial coefficients up to `3 * (n + 1)`.
5. Backward iteration to calculate coefficients of `p(x-1)` and `p(x-2)`.
6. Remove extra elements at the beginning of the `p` vector.
7. Answer queries based on calculated coefficients.
8. Print each answer modulo 10^9+7.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference from the hard version is that in this version all coordinates are even.

There are n fence-posts at distinct coordinates on a plane. It is guaranteed that no three fence posts lie on the same line.

There are an infinite number of cows on the plane, one at every point with integer coordinates.

Gregor is a member of the Illuminati, and wants to build a triangular fence, connecting 3 distinct existing fence posts. A cow strictly inside the fence is said to be enclosed. If there are an odd number of enclosed cows and the area of the fence is an integer, the fence is said to be interesting.

Find the number of interesting fences.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 6000), the number of fence posts which Gregor can choose to form the vertices of a fence.

Each of the next n line contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x,y ≤ 10^7, x and y are even), where (x,y) is the coordinate of a fence post. All fence posts lie at distinct coordinates. No three fence posts are on the same line.

Output

Print a single integer, the number of interesting fences. Two fences are considered different if they are constructed with a different set of three fence posts.

Examples

Input


3
0 0
2 0
0 4


Output


1


Input


5
0 0
2 16
30 14
4 6
2 10


Output


3

Note

In the first example, there is only 1 fence. That fence is interesting since its area is 4 and there is 1 enclosed cow, marked in red.

In the second example, there are 3 interesting fences. 

  * (0,0) — (30,14) — (2,10) 
  * (2,16) — (30,14) — (2,10) 
  * (30,14) — (4,6) — (2,10) 

## Let's think step by step.

1. Read the number of fence posts `n`.
2. Initialize a 2x2 array `cnt` to store the count of fence posts based on the parity of coordinates.
3. Loop to read the coordinates of each fence post.
4. Divide the coordinates by 2 to handle even coordinates.
5. Update the count based on the parity of coordinates.
6. Initialize a variable `ans` to store the number of interesting fences.
7. Loop to iterate over all combinations of parity for x and y coordinates.
8. Calculate the number of interesting fences using combinations.
9. Print the result.

-------

Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.

Gregor's favorite prime number is P. Gregor wants to find two bases of P. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers a and b which satisfy both of the following properties.

  * P mod a = P mod b, where x mod y denotes the remainder when x is divided by y, and 
  * 2 ≤ a < b ≤ P. 



Help Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each subsequent line contains the integer P (5 ≤ P ≤ {10}^9), with P guaranteed to be prime.

Output

Your output should consist of t lines. Each line should consist of two integers a and b (2 ≤ a < b ≤ P). If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.

Example

Input


2
17
5


Output


3 5
2 4

Note

The first query is P=17. a=3 and b=5 are valid bases in this case, because 17 mod 3 = 17 mod 5 = 2. There are other pairs which work as well.

In the second query, with P=5, the only solution is a=2 and b=4.

## Let's think step by step.

1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. Initialize an array `array` to store prime numbers for each test case.
3. Read the prime numbers for each test case and store them in the array.
4. Iterate over each test case to find bases.
5. Print bases `a` and `b` for each test case, where `a = 2` and `b = P - 1`.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for all test cases.
